# GHS-Income-Analysis
 Analyzing South African household salaries using GHS data with SRS, stratified, and cluster sampling methods in SAS.
# General Household Survey Analysis – STAT395 Final Project

This project analyzes household monthly salary data from the South African General Household Survey (GHS) to estimate key economic indicators that can guide government policy and socio-economic research.

##  Project Objectives

- Estimate the **average household monthly salary** in South Africa.
- Calculate the **proportion of households** earning **less than R4500** per month (poverty threshold).
- Estimate the **total monthly salary** generated by all households.

##  Data Details

- Source: General Household Survey (GHS)
- Focus Variable: `LAB_SALARY_HH` (Monthly Salary)
- Additional Variables Used:
  - `FIN_INC_MAIN`: Filters households whose main income is salary
  - `PROP`: Created to indicate households earning < R4500
  - `FIN_EXP`: Used for **stratification** based on monthly expenditure
  - `PROV`: Used as the **clustering** variable (province)

##  Sampling Methods Applied

1. **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** – With and without replacement
2. **Stratified Sampling** – Using monthly household expenditure as strata
3. **Cluster Sampling** – Using province as the cluster unit

Each method was used to estimate:
- Mean monthly salary
- Total salary
- Proportion earning below R4500

##  Statistical Tools Used (SAS Procedures)

- `PROC IMPORT` – Import Excel data
- `PROC SURVEYSELECT` – Sampling
- `PROC SURVEYMEANS` – Estimation of mean, total, and proportion
- `PROC FREQ`, `PROC MEANS`, `DATA STEP` – Data preparation and summary

## Key Results (from Stratified Sampling – most accurate)

- **Estimated Average Salary**: ~R19,547  
  95% CI: R13,912 – R25,182  
- **Estimated Total Salary**: ~R166,854,997  
  95% CI: R118.75M – R214.96M  
- **Proportion Earning < R4500**: 0.333  
  95% CI: 0.322 – 0.344

## Conclusion

- **Stratified Sampling** gave the most reliable and narrowest confidence intervals.
- Around **33% of households** earn **less than R4500**, indicating a significant population requiring financial support.
- Estimated **total household salary** is a useful economic indicator for tax and GDP contributions.
